# OghmAI Android App

OghmAI is a simple Android app designed as a vocabulary coach, focused on language learning through AI-powered interactions. 

This mobile client is the companion to the [OghmAI backend service](https://github.com/gASK13/oghmai-server/) and serves as a proof-of-concept for a language immersion and vocabulary learning experience.

## üì± Purpose

The goal of the app is to help users improve their vocabulary in a target language (initially Italian) by offering features such as:

- Describing unknown words via natural language
- Saving learned words
- Viewing saved vocabulary
- Future plans for testing mastery and progress tracking

Secondary purpose is to try "vibe coding" and kick-start Android app development skill by leveraging AI. Most of the code in this repository will be initially generated by AI with prompting and management by developer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Status

**Proof of Concept (POC):**
- Basic UI implemented using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**
- Working integration with backend APIs:
    - Describe a word
    - Save a word
    - Delete all words
- Settings and environment support for switching API endpoints and API keys

More features are under development.

## ü§ñ Use of AI

This project leverages **Amazon Bedrock** and **LLMs (Amazon Titan / Nova)** to generate:
- Translations
- Definitions
- Example usage in the target language

The Android app interfaces with a FastAPI backend, which uses Bedrock to handle the AI processing.

## üîê Dev Notes

Secrets like API keys and endpoints are managed via `BuildConfig` and `.gitignore`d `local.properties` to keep them out of version control.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose**
- **Retrofit + Gson**
- **FastAPI** (backend)
- **AWS Lambda + DynamoDB**
- **Amazon Bedrock (LLMs)**
